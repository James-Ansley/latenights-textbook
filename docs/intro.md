# Introduction

Welcome to the LateNights Textbook :tada:

A practical introduction to programming using the Python programming language.

## Code Windows

Throughout the textbook there will be several runnable and editable code
examples.
Click on the code windows to edit them and play around.
Run and reset buttons will appear in the top right when hovering over the 
windows.

```python
def foo():
    print('Go Ahead. Try editing this window!')
    bar()


def bar():
    print('Click the run icon in the top right to run this code!')


foo()
```

We encourage you to try these out and play around with them.
A great way to learn programming is to play around with code and to see what
happens.
But, be warned, your changes will be reset if you reload the page.

## Feedback

We are constantly looking to improve the site.
