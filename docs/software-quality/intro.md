# Software Quality

One thing you will learn more as you develop as a programmer, is that it is 
***not*** enough to write code that just "passes all the test cases".
If you want to be taken seriously as a developer, the code you write needs 
to be of overall _high quality_ â€“ if it isn't, it's a telltale sign you, as 
a developer, don't know what you're doing.

In this section, we will begin to talk a bit about what software quality is 
and why it's important.
